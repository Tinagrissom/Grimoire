# Grimoire

A full-stack application using MERN stack: Node.js, Mongoose, Express, and React.

Model created for our Grimoire entries and have full CRUD routes and capabilities.

Delpoyed online with Heroku: https://mygrimoire.herokuapp.com/    
Developed with GitHub: https://github.com/Tinagrissom/Grimoire/tree/dev

On load the user will see our app name and small description blurb below. An About button is visible and when clicked will load a modal that displays a more detailed description of Grimoires and the history of Grimoires. At the bottom of the modal the creators are named with links to each creator's LinkedIn page.

A form section will allow users to add entries to the Grimoire, with inputs for type of entry, image, date, and description.

Once the entry is entered it will load at the bottom after the entries before it.

The user can edit and delete all entries.

Things we would add if given more time:

  1. Make the entries clickable - and when clicked will display large enough to cover the page.
  2. Make a user/login function available
